# Zane's curtains

A little side project to voice control my curtains

## explaination

Using a raspberry pi zero, some adafruit servo robotics supplies, and this code repo, I seek to be able to open and close my curtains by asking siri on my homepod mini. In addition, I want to set my curtains to open and close automatically at a time I choose.

I'll post updates as the software and hardware come together.
